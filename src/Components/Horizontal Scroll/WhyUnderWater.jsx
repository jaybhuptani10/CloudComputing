              Renewable energy: The Orkney Islands provided a 100% renewable
              energy grid, allowing Microsoft to test the underwater datacenter
              on a grid that would be considered unreliable for land-based
              datacenters.

              Remote location: The remote location of the Orkney Islands made it
              an ideal place to test the deployment and retrieval of the
              underwater datacenter without affecting nearby communities or
              infrastructure.

              Strong tidal currents: The strong tidal currents in the Orkney
              Islands provided a natural cooling mechanism for the underwater
              datacenter, reducing the need for energy-intensive cooling
              systems.

              Experimental purpose: Phase 2 of Project Natick was primarily an
              experiment to test the feasibility and sustainability of
              underwater datacenters. The Orkney Islands provided a suitable
              location for these tests.
